## About

The Integrated Student Managing Information (ISMI) System is a C-based project that provides a menu-driven interface for managing student information. It allows you to add, find, update, and delete student records, as well as export student data to CSV files. The project is designed as a learning tool and a reference for managing student data efficiently.

## Features

1. **Add Student Information**: You can add student details, including their first name, last name, roll number, CGPA, and course IDs.

2. **Find Student Information**: Find students by roll number, first name, or course ID, and view their details.

3. **Update Student Information**: Update student records, including their first name, last name, roll number, CGPA, and course IDs.

4. **Delete Student Records**: Remove student records from the system by roll number.

5. **Export to CSV**: Export the student data to a CSV file for external use or reporting.

6. **Data Validation**: Validate GPA input to ensure it falls within the acceptable range (0.0 - 4.0).

7. **Student Sorting**: Sort students based on criteria such as roll number, CGPA, or first name.
